#  Image Filtering and Noise Removal 

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates **basic image filtering techniques** using **Python and OpenCV** to reduce noise and enhance image quality.
The system applies **Gaussian Blur**, **Median Filtering**, and **Image Smoothing** on a given input image and displays the results for comparison.

## Objectives

* To understand **spatial filtering** techniques
* To reduce noise from digital images
* To enhance image clarity for further image processing tasks
* To gain hands-on experience with **OpenCV in Python**

##  Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **OpenCV**
* **NumPy**
* **Matplotlib**
* **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook**

##  Filtering Techniques Implemented

### 1️⃣ Gaussian Blur

* Reduces **Gaussian noise**
* Smoothens the image using a Gaussian kernel

### 2️⃣ Median Filter

* Effective for **salt-and-pepper noise**
* Preserves edges better than averaging filters

### 3️⃣ Image Smoothing (Averaging)

* Reduces sharp variations
* Improves overall smoothness

##  How to Run the Project (Google Colab)

1. Open **Google Colab**
2. Upload the Python file or notebook
3. Run the code cell
4. Upload the input image (`image_filtering.png`) when prompted
5. View and download the filtered output images

##  Input & Output

### Input

* Original image uploaded by the user

### Output

* Gaussian blurred image
* Median filtered image
* Smoothed image


##  Results

The filtering techniques successfully reduce noise and enhance the image quality.
Median filtering performs best for impulse noise, while Gaussian blur is effective for smooth noise reduction.


##  Learning Outcomes

* Understanding image preprocessing
* Knowledge of spatial domain filtering
* Practical experience with OpenCV
* Visualization of image transformations

## Future Enhancements

* Add **noise generation** (salt & pepper, Gaussian)
* Implement **edge detection**
* Extend to **medical image preprocessing**
* Compare results using quantitative metrics
